## Why this exists

We don't want a trivia quiz. We want to watch you think like an engineer for a few hours: get data out of a platform that actively doesn't want to give it to you, and make a screen a user would actually want to stare at. Two tasks, both shipped by the same person who'll sit next to you in six months. Have fun with it — we mean that literally, see the bonus round.

## Logistics

- **Pick one track:** Part 1 (scraper) or Part 2 (home page). Not both. Go deep on the one you pick instead of half-assing two.
- **Stack:** your call. Use whatever language, framework, or no framework you're fastest and most honest in. We're grading judgment, not tool choice.
- **AI tools:** Allowed. Expected, even. What isn't allowed: submitting output you can't explain line-by-line in the follow-up call. See "How we grade" below.
- **Submit:** deployed URL + GitHub repo link + a 1-page `DECISIONS.md`, all through the form in "Submission" below.

## Part 1 — Getting Data Out of a Platform That Doesn't Want You To

We need job listings from sites like LinkedIn, Indeed, Naukri, and Wellfound — none of which offer a free, no-strings API. All of them actively detect and ban bots: fingerprinting headless browsers, rate-limiting by IP, CAPTCHA-walling anything that smells automated. This task isn't about what you do with the data once you have it. It's about **how you get it out at all, repeatedly, without getting the account or IP burned by Tuesday.**

**Deliverable:** a deployed working demo (any live host — Render, Railway, a VPS, whatever's free) that actually pulls listings from at least one real source without getting instantly blocked, plus a design document (diagrams welcome) covering:

1. **Detection surface** — what specifically gives an automated client away on a site like this (headless fingerprints, request timing, missing headers, behavioral patterns), and which of those your design accounts for.

2. **Ingestion strategy** — how you pull data while staying under the radar: rotation, pacing, session/identity management, fallback when a source starts blocking you mid-run. What's your plan B when the primary approach gets shut down in a week?

3. **Resilience** — the source changes its markup overnight, or rate-limits you, or a response comes back empty. What keeps the pipeline running instead of silently failing?

4. **Where you'd stop** — every platform here has terms of service against scraping. Where's your personal and technical line, and how does the design respect it while still getting the job done?

### Scope guardrail

Run your live demo against **one low-risk source** — a public job-board RSS/API, or a sandbox you control — not a live LinkedIn account. We want to see the ingestion pattern work end-to-end, not watch you get an account banned or breach a real ToS on our behalf.

## Part 2 — The Premium Home Page

Take an existing product (real or one you invent a believable pitch for) and redesign its home page as if a Product Hunt front page depended on it. The goal is the "wow, I want an account" reaction in the first 3 seconds. This is where we find out who has taste, not just who can center a div.

**Deliverable:** a working, responsive home page, deployed to a live URL (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, anything free). Pick whatever ships fastest for you — static HTML/CSS, a component framework, a design tool handoff with real code behind it, doesn't matter. Include:

- Hero section with a clear value prop and one strong call to action.
- At least one section that shows the product, not just claims about it (a screenshot, a mock dashboard card, a demo interaction — your call).
- A motion or micro-interaction that earns its keep (scroll reveal, hover state, animated stat — not five of them).
- Working at **390px mobile width** and **1440px desktop**, no horizontal scroll, real dark-mode support if you attempt dark mode at all (all-or-nothing — half-dark is worse than none).

**Constraint that separates signal from noise:** no fabricated testimonials, fake user counts, or fake logos. If you don't have real numbers, write copy that's honest and still compelling. This is the single biggest thing we grade on.

## Written Explanation (DECISIONS.md, 1 page max)

Answer these, briefly:

1. Why this ingestion strategy over the obvious alternative you rejected?
2. One trade-off you made under the time limit, and what you'd do with a real week.
3. Where did you use AI tools, and what did you personally verify or change afterward?

## Submission

Submit everything through this form: [https://forms.gle/qeqpHhvYGWA3ftY69](https://forms.gle/qeqpHhvYGWA3ftY69) — deployed URL and GitHub repo link. One entry per candidate, whichever track you picked.

## How We Grade

| Axis | What we're actually looking at |
|------|--------------------------------|
| **Systems thinking** | Does the ingestion design survive a source detecting and blocking it mid-run? |
| **UI craft & taste** | Does the home page look shipped, not scaffolded — spacing, type, motion restraint? |
| **Honesty** | Did you resist the fake-testimonial trap? Real screenshots/data over invented polish? |
| **Ownership** | In the follow-up call, can you defend every decision without "the AI suggested it"? |

## Bonus round (optional)

Hide one easter egg in the home page — a Konami code, a hover secret, whatever. Costs zero grading points if skipped. Costs zero grading points if found. We just like finding them.
